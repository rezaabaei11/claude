FSX.PY IMPROVEMENT REPORT
================================================================================

CHANGES MADE:

num_leaves: 80 → 31
  Reason: Reduce tree complexity and prevent overfitting

min_data_in_leaf: 30 → 50
  Reason: Higher minimum samples per leaf = less overfitting

lambda_l1: 0.3 → 1.0
  Reason: Increase L1 regularization (3.3x stronger)

lambda_l2: 2.0 → 3.0
  Reason: Increase L2 regularization (1.5x stronger)

early_stopping_rounds: None → 50
  Reason: Stop training when validation doesn't improve
